## Abstract
The Pareto frontier is extensively adopted in multi-objective optimization, especially in multi-carrier energy
system modeling. Despite the various methodologies available to derive the frontier, it represents different
optimal solutions, making the final selection non-trivial. The modeler’s expertise is crucial in determining
the weight factors assigned to each objective for selecting the final solution from the Pareto frontier. This
study proposes a novel approach to support such decision-making, introducing an additional key performance
indicator, the state of health of the battery, evaluated through physical battery modeling. By comparing
different scheduling schemes in multi-objective multi-carrier energy systems, each with its distinct battery
operational strategy, this newly introduced indicator has deployed to automatically identify the ultimate
solution from the Pareto frontier, without additional weighting coefficients. Such an approach, therefore,
automates the decision process, which supports easy engineering, especially for the small scale multi-energy
systems such as smart homes, like the case study presented in this work that has four distinct energy carriers,
adopting the 12 V 128 Ah LFP chemistry Li-ion battery modules, demonstrates the effectiveness of this
automated selection process. Furthermore, when compared to the maximum values across the entire frontier,
the automatically chosen solution exhibits reductions of 27.96% in CO2
emissions and 3.67% reduction in
overall costs. Over long-term operation, this approach has the potential to extend battery lifespan by up to
26.67%, directly impacting the economics of multi-carrier energy systems.
