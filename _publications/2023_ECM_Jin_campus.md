## Abstract
The European Union defined the ambitious carbon-neutrality goal for 2050. Such a transition must be done 
gradually to avoid huge investments; therefore, medium-term energy planning of energy supply systems must be 
performed properly considering both economic and environmental aspects. Sector coupling measures aid to 
achieve this ambitious target, although they require a remarkable financial investment. This paper presents an 
innovative methodology for the medium-term energy planning of the university campus “Marche Polytechnic 
University” located in Italy towards the carbon neutrality, i.e., 50 % of carbon emissions reduction by considering financial investment aspects. The university campus is a multi-carrier local energy community with multiple technologies such as photovoltaic, combined heat and power, gas-fired boilers, absorption, and electric 
chillers that satisfy the end-users’ energy demand. A different mix of installed and new technologies (e.g., energy 
storage or hydrogen) are investigated through the Calliope framework. The case studies present the economicbased optimal scenario of a typical year planning, guaranteeing the same 50 % carbon emissions reduction. 
Results underline the importance of exploiting synergies among multiple carriers and the essential role of i) 
renewables (e.g., additional 3.3 MW of photovoltaic to be installed), ii) batteries with a capacity of 7 MWh, and 
(iii) sector coupling technologies.
