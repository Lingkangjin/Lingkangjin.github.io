## Abstract
The constant operation of water electrolyzers prevents degradation caused by operational fluctuations, preserving
performance. Thisstudy introduces a MILP-based design framework for hybrid energy storage systems, integrating
photovoltaic systems, Lithium-ion batteries, and alkaline electrolyzers operating at constant rated conditions. The
framework targets energy-independent residential users, fully meeting electrical loads while incorporating spatial
analysis via a GIS-based management module. Applied to the Italian context, the framework uses historical data
for residential end-users with 1.5−3.0 kW electrical loads. The results indicate photovoltaic systems sized between
3.0−4.5 kW, Lithium-ion batteries with 6.0−7.0 kWh capacity, and alkaline electrolyzers sized at 100−260 W for
daily loads of 2.8−6.0 kWh. Lithium-ion batteries account for approximately 60 % of the total system cost. A
levelized hydrogen cost of 12−19 €/kg is required to cover the overall investment costs. Additionally, the system
offers environmental benefits, with CO2
emission reductions of approximately 0.35 to 0.83 tons per user annually.
