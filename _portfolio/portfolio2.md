  **Description**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
  A lack of grid capacity that hinders the connection of renewable energy generation is often not found in the local grid in the immediate vicinity of the initiative. The biggest challenges arise in the medium and high-voltage grids. The reason for this is that these grid levels are subject to the combined influence of large numbers of installations for sustainable electricity production from solar and wind energy, and that the lead times for realizing capacity expansions increase as the voltage level rises. This is why existing projects mainly focus on solutions at the higher grid levels. Low-voltage grids can be upgraded in a matter of months, but for medium- and certainly high-voltage grids, this can easily take 5 to 10 years. Concepts, technologies, and systems are being developed everywhere to alleviate the pressure of renewable electricity generation installations on the higher grid levels.
