ABSTRACT = {The combination of different energy vectors like electrical energy, hydrogen, methane, and water is a crucial aspect to deal with in integrated local energy communities (ILECs). The ILEC stands for a set of active energy users that maximise benefits and minimise costs using optimisation procedures in producing and sharing energy. In particular, the proper management of different energy vectors is fundamental for achieving the best operating conditions of ILECs in terms of both energy and economic perspectives. To this end, different solutions have been developed, including advanced control and monitoring systems, distributed energy resources, and storage. Energy management planning software plays a pivotal role in developing ILECs in terms of performance evaluation and optimisation within a multi-carrier concept. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of ILECs is further enhanced by providing important details on the critical aspects related to the overall value chain for constituting an ILEC (e.g., conceptualisation, connecting technologies, barriers/limitations, control, and monitoring systems, and modelling tools for planning phases). By providing a clear understanding of the technical solutions and energy planning software, this paper can support the energy system transition towards cleaner systems by identifying the most suitable solutions and fostering the advancement of ILECs.},

abstract = {Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is the most mature electrochemical technology for hydrogen production from renewable electricity. Thus, its mathematical modeling is an important tool to provide new perspectives for the design and optimization of energy storage and decarbonization systems. However, current models rely on numerous empirical parameters and neglect variations of temperature and concentration alongside the electrolysis cell, which can impact the application and reliability of the simulation results. Thus, this study proposes a simple four-parameter semi-empirical model for AWE system analysis, which relies on minimal fitting data, while providing reliable extrapolation results. In addition, the effect of model dimensionality (i.e., 0D, 1/2D and 1D) are carefully assessed in the optimization of an AWE system. The results indicate that the proposed model can accurately reproduce literature data from four previous works (R2≥0.98), as well as new experimental data. In the system optimization, the trade-offs existing in the lye cooling sizing highlight that maintaining a low temperature difference in AWE stacks (76–80 °C) leads to higher efficiencies and lower hydrogen costs.}
